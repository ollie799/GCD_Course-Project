## ReadMe: Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This is a collection of files created for the final course project for
Getting and Cleaning Data.

The "run_analysis.R" script performs the following:
         
1.  Loads the reshape2 package to the environment

2.  Downloads the files for the UCI HAR Dataset if they are not already present in the working directory

3.  Loads the activity and feature data

4.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

5.  Merges the training and test sets into one 

6.  Assigns variable labels, classes, and levels

7.  Creates a text file with the resultant data set called "independent_dataset.txt"

The final dataset is available through the file "independent_dataset.txt", and the data corresponds to the code book contained within "CodeBook.Rmd".
